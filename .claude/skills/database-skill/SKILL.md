# Database Skill

## Instructions

1. **Table Creation**
   - Define tables with appropriate column types
   - Set primary and foreign keys
   - Include constraints like NOT NULL and UNIQUE

2. **Migrations**
   - Use migration tools to apply schema changes safely
   - Track migration history to avoid conflicts
   - Rollback migrations if needed

3. **Schema Design**
   - Design normalized and efficient schemas
   - Optimize for query performance
   - Consider indexing and relationships
   - Plan for scalability and future growth

## Best Practices
- Name tables and columns clearly and consistently
- Avoid redundant or duplicate data
- Document schema changes
- Follow database-specific conventions (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- Test queries and migrations in a safe environment before production
